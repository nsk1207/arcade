A Jekyll theme inspired by classic 8bit games.

## Preview

You can see how the theme looks like [here](http://julianofernandes.com.br/jekyll-theme-8bit/).

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-theme-8bit"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-theme-8bit
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-theme-8bit

## Contents

**jekyll-theme-8bit** has been scaffolded by the `jekyll new-theme` command and therefore has all the necessary files and directories to have a new Jekyll site up and running with zero-configuration.

### Layouts

Refers to files within the `_layouts` directory, that define the markup for your theme.

- `default.html` &mdash; The base layout that lays the foundation for subsequent layouts. The derived layouts inject their contents into this file at the line that says `{{ content }}` and are linked to this file via [FrontMatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) declaration `layout: default`.
- `post.html` &mdash; The layout for your posts.

### Includes

Refers to snippets of code within the `_includes` directory that can be inserted in multiple layouts (and another include-file as well) within the same theme-gem.

- `downloads.html` &mdash; Insert download buttons when using the theme on a project with GitHub Pages enabled and the `show_downloads` variable set to *true* in `_config.yml`.
- `footer.html` &mdash; Defines the site's footer section.
- `fork-me.html` &mdash; Shows a *"Fork me on GitHub"* link when using the theme on a project with GitHub Pages enabled.
- `google-analytics.html` &mdash; Inserts Google Analytics module (active only in production environment).
- `head.html` &mdash; Code-block that defines the `<head></head>` in  _default_ layout.
- `header.html` &mdash; Defines the site's main header section. By default, pages with a defined `title` attribute will have links displayed here.
- `social.html` &mdash; Icons for social networks. Wich icons will be visible depends on what was defined in `_config.yml`.

### SASS

Refers to `.scss` files within the `_sass` directory that define the theme's styles.

- `fonts.scss` &mdash; Defines font faces used by 8bit's theme.
- `jekyll-theme-8bit.scss` &mdash; The core file imported by preprocessed `assets/css/style.scss`, it defines the defaults for the theme, layout, etc, and also further imports sass partials to supplement itself.
- `rouge-github.scss` &mdash; Defines the styles for syntax-highlighting.

### Assets

Refers to various asset files within the `assets` directory.

- `css/style.scss` &mdash; Imports sass files from within the `_sass` directory. It is what gets processed into the theme's main stylesheet `main.css` called by `_layouts/default.html` via `_includes/head.html`.
- `fonts/Press-Start-2P/` &mdash; The directory contains font files for *ttf*, *woff* and *woff2* formats.
- `js/scale-fix.js` &mdash; Zooming scale fix for iPhone.

This directory can include sub-directories to manage assets of similar type (`img`, `fonts`, `svg`), and will be copied over as is, to the final transformed site directory.

### Plugins

**jekyll-theme-8bit** comes with two plugins preinstalled.

- [`jekyll-paginate`](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/) &mdash; Allows break the main listing of posts up into smaller lists and display them over multiple pages. See [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/) for more details.
- [`jekyll-seo-tag`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag) &mdash; Ensure your website gets the most useful meta tags. See [usage](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/blob/master/docs/usage.md) to know how to set it up.

## Usage

### Customization

For details on how to customize the layout, style and configurations head to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) documentation, it has detailed information about everything you might need.

So far 8bit theme specific customizations are only available through entries in `_config.yml`.

#### Custom logo

Set **logo** entry in `_config.yml`. It accepts an image path like `assets/img/logo.png` or one of the available Nintendo characters provided by [NES.css](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/): `nes-mario`, `nes-ash`, `nes-pokeball`, `nes-bulbasaur`, `nes-charmander`, `nes-squirtle`, `nes-kirby`.

**PS**.: Nintendo owns the copyright of these characters. Please comply with the Nintendo guidelines and laws of the applicable jurisdiction.

#### Showing download buttons

If youâ€™re publishing on GitHub Pages for a project you can enable the download buttons by just setting `show_downloads: true` in `_config.yml`.

#### Social networks

You can show links for accounts you have on some of the most popular social networks. See the example below with the complete list of available networks.

```yaml
# file: _config.yml

social:
  twitter: https://twitter.com/username
  facebook: https://facebook.com/username
  github: https://github.com/username
  youtube: https://youtube.com/channel/ID
  google: https://plus.google.com/username
  medium: https://medium.com/@username
  twitch: https://twitch.com/username
  reddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/username
  whatsapp: tel:+5541999999999
  gmail: mailto:username@domain.net
  linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/username
```

#### Comments

Comments feature is provided by an integration between Jekyll and Disqus, so if you want to have a comments section below each post you will need a Disqus account.

If you already have an account all you need to do is add the following entries to your `_config.yml`:

```yaml
disqus:
  shortname: your-sites-shortname
```

In case you still don't have an account take a look at [Disqus](https://disqus.com)' page for details on how to create and configure an account.

Comments are enabled by default but if you want to disable them for one particular post you can by just adding `comments: false` to the post's YAML Front Matter.

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `jekyll-theme-8bit.gemspec` accordingly.

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
